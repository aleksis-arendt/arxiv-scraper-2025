Some main theorems in Yang's proof hold under a weaker condition called weak RC-positivity. It is therefore natural to ask if (uniform) weak RC-positivity implies (uniform) RC-positivity. Another motivation for studying this problem is to understand the relation between rational connectedness of $X$ and (uniform) RC-positivity of the holomorphic tangent bundle $TX$.   In this paper, we obtain results in this direction. In particular, we show that if a vector bundle $E$ is uniformly weakly RC-positive, then $S^kE\\otimes \\det E$ is uniformly RC-positive for any $k\\geq 0$, and $S^kE$ is uniformly RC-positive for $k$ large. We also discuss an approach that might lead to a solution to the question of whether weak RC-positivity of $E$ implies RC-positivity of $E$."},

The proof in [9] made use of the positive resolution of the surface subgroup conjecture [15].

However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples.

We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces.

Our first main result establishes that, over the moduli space of cscK metrics, the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations carries a natural complex structure together with a family of pseudo-Kähler metrics forming a Kähler fibration with a Kähler Ehresmann connection.

Next, we relate the basic cohomology of a singular Riemannian foliation with that of its blow-up, generalizing well-known, classical analogous results in algebraic and complex geometry.

The essential step of the construction is the incorporation of the boundary-defining function among the fields of the theory, which allows us to realise the asymptotic boundary as a space-time submanifold by employing the gauge PDE implementation of Penrose's concept of asymptotically-simple space. In so doing the gauge PDE describing the boundary structure is obtained by restricting to the boundary of spacetime and simultaneously restricting to the boundary of the field space by setting the boundary defining function to zero. To implement this step systematically we introduce a notion of $Q$-boundary which seems to be new. The main concrete result of this work is the construction of the efficient boundary calculus, which gives a recursive procedure to obtain the explicit form of the equations satisfied by the boundary fields and their gauge transformations for boundary dimension $d \\geq 3$. These include obstruction equations (such as Bach equation or Yang-Mills equation for $d=4$) and generalised conservation equations in the subleading sector. In particular, we derive the explicit form of the higher conformal Yang-Mills equation for $d=8$. The approach is very general and, in principle, applies to generic (gauge) fields on the Einstein gravity background producing a conformally-invariant gauge theory on the boundary, which describes their boundary structure. It can be considered as an extension of the Fefferman-Graham construction that takes into account both the leading and the subleading sector of the bulk fields."},

We prove that the conformal time separation function $τ_Ω$ (and the causal structure it induces) yields a Lorentzian pre-length structure if the original space is intrinsic and strongly causal. This allows us to construct a notion of conformal transformation between spaces within this class, yielding an equivalence relation. As applications, we show that the conformal length functional agrees with the standard conformal length of (strongly causal) spacetimes. We also prove conformal invariance of angles and causality conditions, give a characterisation of global hyperbolicity via finiteness of $τ_Ω$ for all conformal factors, and establish the behaviour of the Lorentzian Hausdorff measure defined in [MS22a] under conformal changes.

Our approach introduces a unified algebraic framework that generalizes the Möbius addition, previously used for the constant curvature case, to define the random walk via a non-Euclidean summation of variables. We demonstrate that the renormalized walk converges to the heat kernel associated with the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$, which plays the role of the limiting normal law.

Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations."},

Iterating this procedure yields the result that all polyharmonic functions of sublinear growth are constant.The key innovation is a new $L^{2}$ estimate for the Laplacian of a polyharmonic function, obtained by induction through a delicate cutoff construction combined with a hole--filling argument.

Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence.

In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \\textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation\" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $Λ$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section."},

The key input is a geometric correlation inequality between the boundary spectral density $Q_Λ$ and the mean curvature $H$, established in all dimensions: in $d=2$ via circular symmetrization, and in $d\\ge 3$ via the boundary Weyl expansion together with the Laugesen--Morpurgo trace minimization principle.

Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability.

According to Hoff, McCormack, and Zhang [J. R. Stat. Soc., B: Stat., 85 (2023), pp. 1659--1679], every covariance matrix $Σ$ of $p_1\\times p_2$ matrix-variate data uniquely decomposes into a separable component $K$ and a core component $C$. Such a decomposition also exists for rank-$r$ $Σ$ if $p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1<r$, with $C$ sharing the same rank. They posed an open question on whether a partial-isotropy structure can be imposed on $C$ for high-dimensional covariance estimation. We address this question by showing that a partial-isotropy rank-$r$ core is a non-trivial convex combination of a rank-$r$ core and $I_p$ for $p:=p_1p_2$, motivating the study of rank-$r$ cores. For fixed $r>p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1$, we prove that the set of rank-$r$ cores, $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, is a compact, smooth, embedded submanifold of the set of rank-$r$ positive semi-definite matrices, except for a measure-zero subset associated with canonical decomposability. When $r=p$, the set of full-rank cores $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ is itself a smooth manifold. Moreover, the positive definite cone $\\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ is diffeomorphic to the product of the Kronecker and core covariance manifolds, providing new geometric insight into $\\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ via separability. Differential geometric quantities, such as the differential of the diffeomorphism, as well as the Riemannian gradient and Hessian operator on $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ and the manifolds used in constructing $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, are also derived.

By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs.

For smooth closed hypersurfaces, we further show that this construction increases the distance between antipodal points of narrow cycles for fixed volume.   We then obtain an explicit range of radii for which the ambient Čech complex on this Grassmannian bundle is homotopy equivalent to the embedded manifold, yielding lower bounds on the scales at which the Čech filtration recovers the homology of $M$. Since the distance induced by the embedding depends on both positions and oriented tangent spaces, we work with Whitney $C^1$ convergence of embeddings and prove that the associated Čech persistent homology is stable with respect to the interleaving distance. Finally, we describe a procedure for computing a distance matrix for a finite subset with respect to this embedding and illustrate the construction on several examples, including an approximate quasi-halo orbit in the Saturn--Enceladus system."},

This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\\tfracγ{2}[L,[L,ρ]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow.

In this framework, particles and fields are treated simultaneously within a single presymplectic manifold, and the Gotay-Nester-Hinds algorithm recovers the full Maxwell-Vlasov equations as the compatibility conditions of a single variational system. The hierarchy of constraints -- including Vlasov advection, Gauss and Faraday laws, and the electromagnetic gauge structure -- arises naturally from the presymplectic geometry of the SR formalism.   Reduction by the diffeomorphism group of phase space produces a reduced presymplectic manifold whose dynamics reproduces both the Euler-Poincare formulation for the Vlasov sector and the Marsden-Weinstein/Morrison-Greene Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structure. We further extend the construction to equilibria that partially break the relabeling symmetry, obtaining a translated SR system that yields an effective symplectic linearization, clarifies the appearance of Goldstone-type neutral modes, and provides a geometric foundation for the energy-Casimir method.   Finally, we incorporate external antenna fields into this setting by introducing affine Hamiltonian controls and establishing a theory of controlled symmetry breaking within the reduced SR framework. This leads to controlled Lie-Poisson equations for plasma-antenna coupling and a geometric mechanism for stabilization through Casimir shaping and symmetry-selective forcing.

We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest."},

We focus on the corank-$2$ case, where we study a natural class of submanifolds, which we call prelegendrians. Their key feature is that they admit a canonical Legendrian lift to the contactisation. Our main results state that the $h$-principle fails for these submanifolds in all dimensions. This is the first example of rigidity in the study of maximally non-integrable distributions, outside of contact topology.   First, we find an infinite family of $(2n+1)$-tori in the standard fat $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$, with the following two properties: (1) They all represent the same formal prelegendrian class, (2) but they are not prelegendrian isotopic because they are distinguished by pseudoholomorphic curve invariants of their Legendrian lift.   Secondly, we define the notion of prelegendrian stabilization in $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$. This allows us to take an arbitrary prelegendrian and produce another one, in the same formal class, whose Legendrian lift is loose.

The analysis is performed through a reformulation of the geometric flow using the support function, enabling a scalar PDE characterization of the evolution. Under specific geometric constraints, we demonstrate that the governing equation admits a Monge Ampére type structure that can exhibit hyperbolic behavior.

In this paper, we consider the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization and obtain the following global results concerning the asymptotic action of Berezin-Toeplitz operators on $H^0(X, L^{\\otimes k})$:   (1). For a general smooth function $f \\in C^\\infty(X)$, we prove that the Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are asymptotic to differential operators acting on $H^0(X, L^{\\otimes k})$ as $k \\to \\infty$.

Given a point and a two-plane in the tangent space, we compare the heat mass transported along that plane with its Euclidean counterpart using the relative entropy of finite measures. We show that the leading small-time distortion of this directional entropy encodes precisely the local curvature of the manifold. In particular, the planar information imbalance determines both the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature at a point, and assembling these directional values produces a bilinear tensor that coincides exactly with the classical Riemannian curvature operator.   The method is entirely analytic and avoids Jacobi fields, curvature identities, or variational formulas. Curvature appears solely through the behaviour of heat flow under the exponential map, providing a new viewpoint in which curvature is realized as an infinitesimal information defect of diffusion. This perspective suggests further connections between geometric analysis and information theory and offers a principled analytic mechanism for detecting and reconstructing curvature using only heat diffusion data."},

We work in the framework of the functional variational approach (FVA), which has the capacity to transfer geometric optimization problems into optimal control problems, the set of admissible shapes being parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. In the FVA setting, we introduce a sensitivity analysis technique that is novel even for smooth PDEs. We emphasize that we do not resort to extensions on the hold-all domain or any kind of approximation of the original PDE. The computation of the directional derivative of the state w.r.t. functional variations results in a new way of computing the shape derivative.

In addition, we introduce the concept of locally optimal shapes and we put into evidence its connection to locally minimizers of the corresponding control problem. With directional differentiability results for the control-to-state map at our disposal, we can then state necessary conditions for locally optimal shapes in general non-smooth settings."},

In this paper, we extend this framework by enriching diffeomorphic deformations with transformations induced by finite-dimensional Lie groups (e.g. isometries, scalings), and we develop a registration model that decouples the actions of these two types of deformation on the shape during the matching process. To achieve this, we consider semidirect products between finite-dimensional groups and groups of diffeomorphisms, endowed with a right-invariant sub-Riemannian structure that give rise to new variational problems for shape registration. By exploiting symmetries and reduction theory, we decouple the contributions of each group throughout the matching process. We further extend the framework to incoroporate anisotropic deformations that preferentially favor certain directions during registration. On the numerical side, we propose an algorithm based on a joint optimization over both deformation groups, in contrast to the standard twostage approach that optimizes first over the finite-dimensional component and then over the diffeomorphic one. Experiments on curves and landmarks demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization improves registration accuracy and more effectively disentangles the contributions of the two deformation groups."},

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds."},

Under an additional assumption on the Lagrangian, such a minimizer is a flow line of the Euler--Lagrange flow. This extends the work of Contreras from closed finite-dimensional manifolds to the infinite-dimensional context. Moreover, our results also extend the recent work of Bauer, Harms, and Michor from geodesic flows to Euler--Lagrange flows of Tonelli Lagrangians. As an application, we obtain global well-posedness of all Euler--Poincare'e equations associated with Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups equipped with strong right-invariant Riemannian metrics."},

We study the degree to which such extensions are unique up to the boundary. Firstly, we find that in general not even the $C^0$-structure of the extension is uniquely determined by the assumption that the metric extends continuously. However, we exhibit an interesting local-global relation regarding the $C^0$-structure which in particular entails its rigidity for ''strongly spherically symmetric'' continuous extensions across the Cauchy horizon of the Reissner-Nordström spacetime. Secondly, we construct continuous extensions which have the same $C^0$-structure, but do not have equivalent $C^1$-structures. This construction also carries over to weak null singularities in 3+1 dimensions. Understanding the uniqueness properties of continuous spacetime extensions to the boundary is of importance for the study of low-regularity inextendibility problems."},

The main purpose of this paper is to transpose this evolution operator to the case of contact mechanics, and to study some of its main properties. In particular, we show that it provides a geometric description of the evolution equations and it relates the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian constraints. To illustrate the theory, we provide examples of singular contact systems based on modified versions of the simple pendulum and the Cawley Lagrangian."},

Specifically, let $M$ denote a diameter 1 d-dimensional manifold and $μ$ a probability measure on $M$ that is mutually absolutely continuous with the volume measure. Suppose $X_1,\\dots,X_N$ are i.i.d. samples of $μ$ and we observe noisy-distance random variables $d'(X_j, X_k)$ that are related to the true geodesic distances $d(X_j,X_k)$. With mild assumptions on the distributions and independence of the noisy distances, we develop a new framework for recovering all distances between points in a sufficiently dense subsample of $M$. Our framework improves on previous work which assumed i.i.d. additive noise with known moments. Our method is based on a new way to estimate $L_2$-norms of certain expectation-functions $f_x(y)=\\mathbb{E}d'(x,y)$ and use them to build robust clusters centered at points of our sample. Using a new geometric argument, we establish that, under mild geometric assumptions--bounded curvature and positive injectivity radius--these clusters allow one to recover the true distances between points in the sample up to an additive error of $O(\\varepsilon \\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$. We develop two distinct algorithms for producing these clusters. The first achieves a sample complexity $N \\asymp \\varepsilon^{-2d-2}\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$ and runtime $o(N^3)$. The second introduces novel geometric ideas that warrant further investigation. In the presence of missing observations, we show that a quantitative lower bound on sampling probabilities suffices to modify the cluster construction in the first algorithm and extend all recovery guarantees. Our main technical result also elucidates which properties of a manifold are necessary for the distance recovery, which suggests further extension of our techniques to a broader class of metric probability spaces."},

The Escobar problem concerning the existence of a metric conformally equivalent to $g$ having constant scalar curvature on $M$ and constant mean curvature on its boundary is equivalent, in analytic terms, to finding a positive solution to a nonlinear boundary-value problem with critical growth. While the existence of positive solutions to this problem is by now well understood, the existence of sign-changing (nodal) solutions remains largely open. In this work we establish the existence of least-energy sign-changing solutions in two particular cases: the scalar-flat problem, where the scalar curvature on $M$ is zero and the mean curvature of its boundary is constant, and the minimal boundary problem, where the mean curvature of the boundary vanishes and the scalar curvature of $M$ is constant. More precisely, we prove that if $n\\ge7$ and $M$ has a nonumbilic boundary point, then both problems admit least-energy nodal solutions. In addition, we show that when $n\\ge5$, the minimal boundary problem possesses infinitely many sign-changing solutions on the unit ball. Our approach is variational and relies on the analysis of suitable conformal invariants and sharp energy estimates derived from Escobar's work."},

Noncancellation allows us to detect parts of the length spectrum from the Laplace spectrum and conclude rational integrability for the deformed geodesic flow (Liouville metrics are folklorically conjectured to be the only Riemannian metrics with integrable geodesic flow on the torus).

A principal fiber bundle over the manifold of density operators distinguishes the quantum state structure from thermodynamic labels: its fibers represent non-equilibrium configurations, and their unique intersections with the equilibrium submanifold enforce thermodynamic consistency. Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law. Non-equilibrium extensions, formulated through pseudo-Riemannian metrics and connections on the principal bundle, introduce curvature-induced holonomy that quantifies irreversibility in cyclic processes.

This work introduces a numerical scheme that approximates infinitesimal generators from data sampled on an unknown smooth manifold, enabling the recovery of continuous symmetries without requiring the analytical form of the differential equations. We employ a manifold learning technique, Generalized Moving Least Squares, to prolongate the data, from which a linear system is constructed whose null space encodes the infinitesimal generators representing the symmetries.

From this we derive the distance minimizing paths which are left or right translations of one-parameter groups (though these are not the unique minizing paths if the norm is not smooth or strictly convex). Then we introduce a notion of sectional curvature $sec(π)$ for a bi-invariant distance, following Milnor's ideas, and we show that this curvature is bounded and non-negative, and it is null when the $2$-plane $π$ is an abelian Lie subalgebra of $Lie(G)$. We show that when the distance is strictly convex, our sectional curvature vanishes if and only if the $2$-plane is abelian.

By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity.

This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis."},

This paper presents new findings on determining whether a system with m inputs and $2m$ or $2m-1$ states is flat by pure prolongation, a specific subclass of differential flatness. While this condition is more restrictive than general differential flatness, the algorithm for computing flat outputs remains remarkably simple, and the verification requirements are relatively lenient.

This paper introduces contrast bi-forms, a generalisation of contrast functions that systematically encode metric and connection data, allowing for arbitrary affine connections regardless of torsion.

This work presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts, key applications, and future prospects.

The endpoints of the drift window correspond to the synchronous and reflection couplings, providing geometric realizations of extremal stochastic drifts.

Therefore, numerical computations of the Fréchet mean require solving an embedded optimization problem in each iteration. We introduce the GEORCE-FM algorithm to simultaneously compute the Fréchet mean and Riemannian distances in each iteration in a local chart, making it faster than previous methods. We extend the algorithm to Finsler manifolds and introduce an adaptive extension such that GEORCE-FM scales to a large number of data points. Theoretically, we show that GEORCE-FM has global convergence and local quadratic convergence and prove that the adaptive extension converges in expectation to the Fréchet mean.

If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature. To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable, meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm attention-induced curvature."},

In this theory, the ``classical'' action is almost uniquely determined by T-symmetry, which is a generalization of the T-duality, where the parameter of ``quantum'' corrections $β$ in the path-integral of the theory is independent of that of quantum corrections $\\hbar$ in the perturbative string theories. We distinguish the effects of $β$ and $\\hbar$ by putting \" \" like \"classical\" and \"loops\" for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $β$, respectively, whereas by putting nothing like classical and loops for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\\hbar$, respectively. A non-renormalization theorem states that there is no ``loop'' correction. Thus, there is no problem of non-renormalizability, although the theory is defined by the path-integral over the fields including a metric on string geometry. No ``loop'' correction is also the reason why the complete path-integrals of the all-order perturbative strings in general string backgrounds are derived from the ``tree''-level two-point correlation functions in the perturbative vacua, although string geometry includes information of genera of the world-sheets of the stings. Furthermore, a non-perturbative correction in string coupling with the order $e^{-1/g_s^2}$ is given by a transition amplitude representing a tunneling process between the semi-stable vacua in the ``classical'' potential by an ``instanton'' in the theory.

Crucially, the moduli of typical factorization structures has a positive dimension, revealing an immensely rich and previously untapped landscape of toric separable geometries. The scalar curvature of toric separable geometries is computed explicitly, necessary conditions for the PDE governing extremality are derived, and new extremal metrics are obtained systematically. In particular, for a $2m$-dimensional toric separable geometry, solutions of the PDE are necessarily $m$-tuples of rational functions of one variable belonging to an at most $(m+2)$-dimensional real vector space and whose denominators are determined by the factorization structure. Toric separable geometries serve as a separation of variables technique and are well-suited for the analytic study of geometric PDEs."},

Originally proved by Schoen-Yau and later Witten, these theorems were established for asymptotically flat manifolds where the metric tends to the standard Euclidean metric and whose second fundamental form decays to zero at infinity. This ansatz on the metric and second fundamental form is motivated by the desire to model an isolated gravitational system with a Minkowski space background for the spacetime. However, actual astrophysical massive objects are not truly isolated but rather exist within an expanding cosmological universe, where the second fundamental form is umbilic. With this in mind, we seek a notion of energy for initial data sets with an umbilic second fundamental form. In this work, we present a definition of energy in such an expanding cosmological setting. Instead of Minkowski space, we take de Sitter space as the background spacetime, which, when written in flat-expanding coordinates, is foliated by umbilic hypersurfaces each isometric to Euclidean 3-space. This cosmological setting necessitates a quasi-local energy definition, as the presence of a cosmological horizon in de Sitter space obstructs a global one. We define energy in this quasi-local setting by adapting the Liu-Yau energy to our framework and establish positivity of this energy for certain bounded values of the cosmological constant."},

We prove an essential curvature identity along those fields on any (semi-)Riemannian manifold and thus generalize the Bochner's theorem for Killing vector fields in this setting. Later we study it in the framework of almost coKähler structure and we prove that the Reeb vector field $ξ$ on an almost coKähler manifold is mixed Killing if and only if the operator $h=0$. Moving further, we completely classify almost coKähler manifolds with $ξ$ mixed Killing vector field in dimension 3. In particular, if $ξ$ on an $η$-Einstein almost coKähler manifold is mixed Killing, then the manifold is of constant scalar curvature with $h=0$.

We provide methods to obtain mixed superposition rules for systems admitting an imprimitive finite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields or given by a semidirect sum.

Within this geometry, one can define difference-angle triangles, norms, bisectors, perpendiculars, and inner products. Several characteristic properties not seen in existing geometries emerge, together with behaviors analogous to those in Euclidean geometry: the triangle inequality always holds with equality, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is $0$, and a Miquel point exists even for parabolas. In particular, the concurrency of the parabolic Miquel configuration was suggested by Weiss and Odehnal, and our main theorem provides the first explicit and rigorous confirmation of this assertion.

Abanov", "Boris Khesin"], "published": "2025-11-01T17:14:51Z", "summary": "In this paper, we present a collection of infinite-dimensional systems with nonholonomic constraints. In finite dimensions the two essentially different types of dynamics, nonholonomic or vakonomic ones, are known to be obtained by taking certain limits of holonomic systems with Rayleigh dissipation, as in [Koz83]. After visualizing this phenomenon for the classical example of a skate on an inclined plane, we discuss its higher-dimensional analogue, the kinematics of a car with $n$ trailers, as well as its limit as $n\\to \\infty$. We show that its infinite-dimensional version is a snake-like motion of the Chaplygin sleigh with a string, and it is subordinated to an infinite-dimensional Goursat distribution.   Other examples of nonholonomic and vakonomic systems include subriemannian and Euler-Poincaré-Suslov systems on infinite-dimensional Lie groups, the Heisenberg chain, the general Camassa-Holm equation, infinite-dimensional geometry of a nonholonomic Moser theorem, parity-breaking nonholonomic fluids, and potential solutions to Burgers-type equations arising in optimal mass transport."},

To compute this invariant, we analyze the framed bordism class of 1-dimensional Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces using the local index theorem by Bismut-Freed. Using this, we deduce new obstructions to the smooth isotopy to the identity for compositions of Dehn twists on $(-2)$-spheres in closed $4$-manifolds. We obtain several applications: (1) We exhibit the first examples of closed simply-connected symplectic $4$-manifolds admitting Torelli symplectomorphisms which are smoothly non-trivial. In particular, their symplectic Torelli mapping class group is not generated by squared Dehn-Seidel twists on Lagrangian spheres -- providing a negative answer to a question of Donaldson. (2) We provide the first examples of irreducible closed $4$-manifolds (both symplectic and non-symplectic) that admit exotic diffeomorphisms given by Seifert-fibered Dehn twist."},

We show that if the initial hypersurface is sufficiently close to a coordinate sphere, these flows exist globally and converge smoothly to a constant mean curvature (CMC) hypersurface, namely a coordinate sphere. For asymptotically Schwarzschild space, if the initial hypersurface has pinched curvature outside of some large compact set, or more orecisely sufficiently close to an isoperimetric hypersurface, outside of some large compact set in C^2 sense, we will apply similar method combined with the center manifold analysis to see that the flow still exists for all time and converges to CMC hypersurface exponentially fast. This in particular gives an existence result for a CMC hypersurface in asymptotically flat space."},

We propose a mesh-free learning framework designed for $n$-dimensional mapping problems, seamlessly combining variational principles with quasi-conformal theory. Our approach ensures accurate, bijective mappings by regulating conformality distortion and volume distortion, enabling robust control over deformation quality. The framework is inherently compatible with gradient-based optimization and neural network architectures, making it highly flexible and scalable to higher-dimensional settings. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical image data validate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed method in complex registration scenarios."},

Being thin, their preferred deformation modes are inextensional, i.e., isometric. Here, we report on a recent characterization of the isometric deformations of periodic surfaces.

Several examples and use cases are presented."},

In this work, we study the conformal analogue problem on closed 3-manifolds: given a Riemannian metric $g$ of class $W^{2,q}$ with $q > 3$, we characterize when a more regular representative exists in its conformal class. We highlight a deep link to the Yamabe problem for rough metrics and present some immediate applications to conformally flat, static and Einstein manifolds."},

The estimates we obtain are quantitative and cover a large class of elliptic equations with polynomial growth. As a particular case we settle the Lipschitz regularity of $p$-harmonic functions for all values of $p\\in(1,\\infty)$, proving also a Cheng-Yau type inequality. These results are the first in this setting that simultaneously address a wide family of elliptic operators and extend beyond the classical Hölder regularity theory. Our strategy rests on the use of Galerkin's method, which we employ as an alternative to the traditional difference quotients technique."},

In both cases, the sequence is studied for appropriate classes of metrics with positive scalar curvature, and it is shown how the Stolz R-groups have a strict dependence on the 2-skeleton. This latter result will then be used in the (G, F) framework to establish an isomorphism between the R-groups for spaces having isomorphic fundamental functors, a suitable generalization of the fundamental group. A universal space is also introduced, where universal means that each space with this characterization admit a map with values in it, inducing isomorphisms at the level of R-groups. Subsequently, the mapping of the Stolz sequence to the Higson-Roe surgery sequence for singular spaces with (L, G)-singularities will be studied. Specifically, a version of the delocalized APS-index theorem, which makes use of localization algebras, will be employed. This includes a description of K-theory for graded $C^{*}-algebras$, which will be introduced for Real $C^{*}-algebras$, with the advantage of simultaneously including both the real and complex case. Finally, as an application of these results, the wedge index difference homomorphism is studied in the singular context. This homomorphism, besides serving as an obstruction for two well-adapted wedge metrics to be concordant, is used to provide a lower bound on the rank of the structure group of such positive scalar curvature metrics, namely the bordism group $Pos_*^{spin,(L,G)}$."},

On closed manifolds, we show that if the magnetic force is nowhere vanishing and the potential is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ norm, then this Ricci curvature is positive for energies close to the maximum value of the potential $e_0$. As a main application, under these assumptions, we extend the existence of contractible closed orbits at energy levels near $e_0$ from almost every to everywhere."},

Independently, we propose a Monge-Ampère-type non-linear pde whose distinctive feature is that its solutions, if any, are forms of positive degree rather than functions.

In the context where $G$ is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we develop tools to find explicit bounds on $c(A)$. We show that the problem reduces to:   1) The adjoint representation of the semisimple quotient $\\mathfrak{s} = \\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{r}$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$ by the radical $\\mathfrak{r}$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$ (which was handled in the paper mentioned above).   2) The action of $\\mathfrak{s}$ on a set of real irreducible representations that arise from quotients of the commutator series of $\\mathfrak{r}$.
